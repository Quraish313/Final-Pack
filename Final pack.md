 I am not a Linux expert by any means–in fact, I’m not even fluent, and don’t use it as my main operating system. However, if I sit down in front of a Linux computer to do some work, I’m perfectly comfortable with using it. I learned how to use the command line comfortably, I also learned what repositories are  for through Github and not to download just whatever interesting-looking  off the Internet (unless I’m doing so to tinker with it), I learned how to do a tiny bit of shell scripting, and I can even compile or interpret my own programs (written in less annoying languages) via the command line. I also learned how to manage files and how to document. I also learned how to get some informations search as RFC, Stackoverflow e.t.c, Finally i learned how to build a file server individually and with a team.
